This is going to take you - oh behind the love seat and then you're going to see a small table with the blue horse on it. Go forward toward those wicker chairs. Take a right. And go forward back into, what looks like the kitchen.  There's a yellow wall with a big white-with an opening that's white. So go forward into- yes, it is the kitchen. So you're going to go through the kitchen to the end. It looks like there might be a pantry on the right-hand-side.
